# Weather-Website
 The project is a weather application that allows users to retrieve and display weather information for a specific city. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML structure defines the layout of the webpage. It includes a card element that serves as the main container for displaying the weather information. Inside the card, there is a search section consisting of an input field and a search button. Users can enter the name of a city they want to check the weather for.

The CSS code provides the styling for the webpage. It defines background gradients, border styles, positioning, and font styles to create an attractive and visually appealing design. The styles are applied to different elements such as the card, input field, button, images, and text elements, ensuring a cohesive and consistent visual presentation.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the weather application. It uses the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input. The code includes an asynchronous function that makes a request to the API, receives the response, and processes the data. It updates the UI dynamically by displaying the fetched weather information such as temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed. The code also includes error handling to display error messages if the entered city name is invalid or if there is a problem with the API request.

Overall, the project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly weather application. Users can search for weather information by entering a city name, and the application fetches and displays the corresponding weather data on the webpage in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
